## Automated Testing Commands

### Start Development Server
```bash
cd react-testing
npm start
```

### Build for Production Testing
```bash
npm run build
npx serve -s build
```

### Performance Auditing
```bash
# Using Lighthouse CLI
lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --preset=desktop
lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --preset=mobile
```

## Screen Size Breakpoints

The application uses the following responsive breakpoints:

```css
/* Mobile first approach */
Default: Mobile phones (up to 767px)
@media (max-width: 480px): Extra small phones
@media (max-width: 768px): Tablets and large phones
@media (min-width: 769px): Desktop (unchanged)
```

## Expected Mobile Behavior

### Header (Mobile)
- Logo centered, smaller size
- Hamburger menu replaces navigation
- Dropdown menu slides down from header
- Touch-friendly navigation items

### Hero Section (Mobile)
- Title scales from 42px to 28px to 22px
- Paragraph text remains readable
- Service dropdown expands to full width
- "Get Started" button optimized for touch

### Features Grid (Mobile)
- 4-column grid becomes single column
- Cards maintain visual hierarchy
- Icons resize appropriately
- Text remains readable

### Footer (Mobile)
- Copyright and privacy link stack vertically
- Privacy link becomes touch-friendly button
- Maintains brand consistency

## Troubleshooting

### Horizontal Scrolling
If you notice horizontal scrolling:
1. Check for elements with fixed widths
2. Verify viewport meta tag is present
3. Look for `100vw` usage in CSS
4. Check for absolute positioned elements

### Touch Target Issues
If buttons are hard to tap:
1. Verify minimum 44px touch targets
2. Check for adequate spacing
3. Ensure z-index layering is correct
4. Test with actual fingers, not stylus

### Performance Problems
If the site is slow on mobile:
1. Check image sizes and formats
2. Audit JavaScript bundle size
3. Test on slower network conditions
4. Use browser performance tools

## Success Criteria

The mobile implementation is successful when:

✅ **No horizontal scrolling** on any screen size
✅ **All interactive elements** are easily tappable
✅ **Typography** remains readable at all sizes
✅ **Navigation** is intuitive and accessible
✅ **Performance** is smooth on mobile networks
✅ **Visual hierarchy** is maintained across devices
✅ **Desktop experience** remains unchanged

## Reporting Issues

When reporting mobile responsiveness issues, please include:

1. **Device/Browser**: Specific device and browser version
2. **Screen Size**: Exact viewport dimensions
3. **Issue Description**: Clear description of the problem
4. **Steps to Reproduce**: How to recreate the issue
5. **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of the problem
6. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen instead

## Next Steps

After testing, consider these enhancements:
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Touch gestures and swipe navigation
- Offline functionality
- Mobile-specific animations
- Advanced image optimization
- Mobile analytics tracking
